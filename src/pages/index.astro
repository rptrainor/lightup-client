      "SafERteen: Trinity Health Muskegon Hospital launches violence reduction program housed in ER",
    description:
      "SafERteens at Trinity Health Muskegon Hospital, a vital initiative of the University of Michigan's Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention, is tackling the urgent crisis of youth gun violence. Driven by Dr. Brian Stork's alarming findings of the high incidence of firearm injuries among young Black men, the majority linked to violent incidents, this program addresses a deeply concerning and costly issue. SafERteens’ innovative approach, implemented since May 2023, involves early identification and intervention for at-risk youths through a targeted screening process. This proactive strategy is not just a response to a staggering problem; it's a community's commitment to safeguarding its children and a call to action for those dedicated to ending the cycle of youth gun violence in Muskegon.",

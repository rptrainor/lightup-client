      <h2>Transforming Cancer Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. June's CAR T cell therapies have shown remarkable results in
        treating acute leukemia in children and adults, and lymphoma in adults.
        Supporting this research contributes to developing more effective,
        targeted treatments for these devastating diseases.
      </p>
      <h2>Advancing Gene Therapy</h2>
      <p>
        The technology developed in the June Laboratory has been pivotal in
        progressing cancer gene therapy. This approach offers a new paradigm in
        treating cancers that have been resistant to traditional therapies.
      </p>
      <h2>Wider Application and Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        With ongoing development and anticipated FDA approval, the therapies
        pioneered by Dr. June are set to become more widely available,
        potentially benefiting a vast number of patients globally.
